# Lemmitization
Lemmatisation (or lemmatization) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form.
For eg - Worked - Work Working - Work Works - Work

### Why do we need Lemmatisation ?

We need lemmatisation to reach the base form of a word in a sentence. Decreasing computational overload can also be regarded as its use case. Suppose a text has work, works, worked, working in it then since NLP converts each text into a vector so, we will have 4 vectors for the text but through lemmatisation, we can end up having just one for the base form.
